# Basic LAN with Static Routing â€“ CCNA Project

This project simulates a simple LAN setup with static routing using Cisco Packet Tracer.

##Topology Overview
- 2 Routers
- 2 Switches
- 4 PCs
- Static routing between routers

## Objectives
- Configure IP addressing and routing
- Test network connectivity using ping
- Demonstrate understanding of static routing

## Files
- `project.pkt`: Packet Tracer simulation file
- `configs/`: Router CLI configurations
- `diagrams/topology.png`: Network layout

## Results
Successful ping between all PCs across the network, showing routing is configured properly.
